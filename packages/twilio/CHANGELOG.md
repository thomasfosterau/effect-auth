## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d904a6: Built for Effect `4.0.0-rc.118`.
  
  Every package above requires `effect >=4.0.0-rc.118`. The published `dist/` imports rc.118's module paths (`effect/http-api`, `effect/http`, `effect/sql`, `effect/persistence`, `effect/process`, and so on), which earlier Effect releases don't have, so install `effect` and any `@effect/*` companion at rc.118 or later.
  
  - **An empty encryption secret is a configuration error.** The stock config providers read an empty environment variable as absent, which would silently turn encryption at rest off. So `JWT_ENCRYPT_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET=""`, `OAUTH_ENCRYPT_TOKENS_SECRET=""` and `TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPT_SECRET=""` fail `jwtServiceConfig`, `oauthServiceOptionsConfig` and `multiFactorConfig` at startup with a `ConfigError` naming the variable ("set but empty"). An **unset** variable means encryption is off. Unset or fix any such variable that your templating or secrets manager renders as `""`. Empty `JWT_ISSUER` and `TRUSTED_DEVICE_SECRET` fail as missing, and an empty `TRUSTED_DEVICE_MAX_AGE_MS` uses its default (#252).

### Patch Changes

- 89802ec: Built and tested against Effect `4.0.0`. The `effect` peer floor is unchanged (`>=4.0.0-rc.118`), so consumers still on `4.0.0-rc.118` keep working; `@effect/*` companions such as `@effect/sql-pg` should match whichever `effect` you install.
- 02df078: Publish from the library tooling standard (#222). Every package now takes its dependency versions
  from the workspace's strict pnpm catalog and its published peer ranges from `catalog:peers`, so the
  ranges consumers see are declared once; the published ranges themselves are unchanged. Releases are
  published by `pnpm publish` through npm OIDC trusted publishing (provenance is left to npm, never forced). The packages' `build` / `test` / `typecheck` scripts moved into Vite+ tasks
  (`build`, `test:unit`, `check`), so the published manifests no longer carry them.
