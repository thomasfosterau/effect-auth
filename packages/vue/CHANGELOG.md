## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cc67083: Framework packages, form components, and adapter reworks.
  
  - Framework bindings moved out of the client into their own packages — `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-react`, `-svelte`, `-vue`, and the new `-solid` — each with idiomatic authoring (React JSX, Svelte 5 runes `.svelte` components, Vue SFCs, Solid JSX with a `"solid"` export condition) and the same six out-of-the-box headless form components: `SignInForm`, `SignUpForm`, `PasswordResetRequestForm`, `PasswordResetConfirmForm`, `MagicLinkForm`, `EmailOtpForm`. The client package no longer has `./react`, `./svelte`, `./vue`, or `./types` subpaths; wire types come from the core package's `Http` namespace, and the client's `emailOTP`/`phoneOTP` sections are now `emailOtp`/`phoneOtp`.
  - `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-drizzle` supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL through per-dialect table modules (`Pg`, `Sqlite`, `MySql`) over a structural database seam, and its store modules are namespaced with `make`/`layer` exports (`SessionStore.make`, `UserStore.layer`, `Requests.layer`, ...).
  - `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-alchemy` was rebuilt: the bespoke D1 wrapper and hand-rolled stores are gone; a D1-backed `SqlClient` now drives the shared `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-sql` stores, and the `AuthSchema` resource runs through the real Alchemy engine.
- ce56aeb: **Breaking (HTTP):** sign-in, sign-up and the flows that prove an address are JSON:API resources (#205). They take `application/vnd.api+json` documents and answer JSON:API documents and error documents.

  | `GET /sign-in/google-one-tap/nonce`                                                                                                                     | `POST /google-one-tap-nonces` (the nonce is the resource's id)                                                                                                                            |
  
  - A sign-in or sign-up that issues a session answers `201` with the `sessions` resource, its user in `included` and `meta.needsEmailVerification`. One that issues none answers `202`: with the `second-factor-challenges` resource to redeem, or with only `meta.needsEmailVerification` when the address must be verified first. The second-factor answer no longer carries the user.
  - Under `antiEnumeration`, `POST /users` answers a fresh address and a held one with the same `202` and no user at all, so neither answer names an id (#195, #414).
  - The sends (`otp-challenges`, `email-verifications`, `password-resets`) answer `202` with no body; a password reset answers `204`; an email verification answers `201` with the session when it signs the user in, else `204`.
  - The default IP rate-limit rules follow the paths: `POST /sessions` (every sign-in method, now including magic-link verification), `POST /users`, `POST /otp-challenges`, `POST /password-resets` and the second-factor verifications.
  - No secret travels in a URL: the reset, verification and second-factor challenge tokens are sent in the request body, so access logs, `Referer` headers and rate-limit keys never carry them.
  - A rate-limit rule whose `path` is a regex now counts every path it matches in one bucket per client address (it was one bucket per path), so a caller cannot reset its count by varying the path.
  - effect-auth-client: the sign-in, sign-up and verification methods keep their arguments and resolve with the new `AuthResult`, whose `user` is present only when a session was issued. `continueChallenge` takes an `AuthResult`. The framework bindings' form `AuthSuccess` type follows it.
  - effect-auth-sveltekit: `credentialAction` sends its body as `application/vnd.api+json` by default (`contentType` overrides it), so an action for `POST /sessions` posts a `sessions` document.

### Patch Changes

- 02df078: Publish from the library tooling standard (#222). Every package now takes its dependency versions
  from the workspace's strict pnpm catalog and its published peer ranges from `catalog:peers`, so the
  ranges consumers see are declared once; the published ranges themselves are unchanged. Releases are
  published by `pnpm publish` through npm OIDC trusted publishing (provenance is left to npm, never forced). The packages' `build` / `test` / `typecheck` scripts moved into Vite+ tasks
  (`build`, `test:unit`, `check`), so the published manifests no longer carry them.
- 5ab875a: The package manifest sets `repository.directory`, as the other effect-auth packages already do, so npm resolves the README's relative links against the package's own directory rather than the repository root, and they no longer 404 on npmjs.com (#265).
