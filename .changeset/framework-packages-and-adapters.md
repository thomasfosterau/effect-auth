Framework packages, form components, and adapter reworks.

- Framework bindings moved out of the client into their own packages — `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-react`, `-svelte`, `-vue`, and the new `-solid` — each with idiomatic authoring (React JSX, Svelte 5 runes `.svelte` components, Vue SFCs, Solid JSX with a `"solid"` export condition) and the same six out-of-the-box headless form components: `SignInForm`, `SignUpForm`, `PasswordResetRequestForm`, `PasswordResetConfirmForm`, `MagicLinkForm`, `EmailOtpForm`. The client package no longer has `./react`, `./svelte`, `./vue`, or `./types` subpaths; wire types come from the core package's `Http` namespace, and the client's `emailOTP`/`phoneOTP` sections are now `emailOtp`/`phoneOtp`.
- `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-drizzle` supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL through per-dialect table modules (`Pg`, `Sqlite`, `MySql`) over a structural database seam, and its store modules are namespaced with `make`/`layer` exports (`SessionStore.make`, `UserStore.layer`, `Requests.layer`, ...).
- `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-alchemy` was rebuilt: the bespoke D1 wrapper and hand-rolled stores are gone; a D1-backed `SqlClient` now drives the shared `@thomasfosterau/effect-auth-sql` stores, and the `AuthSchema` resource runs through the real Alchemy engine.
